The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/markelly4/myproject/tree/faf9daac40d730cf1e8f251782911342c1181a2b" target="_blank">faf9daa</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were
made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/methods.Rmd</code>) and HTML
(<code>docs/methods.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote
Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the

<p>Below we describe the data inputs and GIS operations.</p>
<div id="landfire-supplied-data-inputs" class="section level2">
<h2>LANDFIRE supplied data inputs</h2>
<p><a href="https://landfire.gov/">LANDFIRE</a> is a large US federal
program that delivers dozens of datasets and hundreds of models for the
US including Alaska, Hawaii and the insular areas such as Puerto
Rico.</p>
<p>We relied on these 3 inputs, all derived from LANDFIRE products:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Map of ecosystem footprints</li>
<li>Estimated ‘reference’ amounts of open and closed succession classes:
Biophysical Settings models</li>
<li>Map of current succession classes: Succession Class data</li>
</ol>
<p>*NOTE: LANDFIRE data is delivered as geotifs with 30M pixel size.</p>
<div id="ecosystem-footprints" class="section level3">
<h3>Ecosystem footprints</h3>
<p>We relied on LANDFIRE’s <a
href="https://landfire.gov/bps.php">“Biophysical Settings” (BpS)</a> to
obtain ‘potential ecosystem footprints’. This dataset is a modeled
depiction of the dominant vegetation systems prior to European
colonization. It was developed with many abiotic inputs such as soils,
surface geology and many climate inputs.</p>
<p>Each BpS, such as a “western hemlock douglas fir forest” is
accompanied by a description that includes information on its succession
classes and a model which captures historical disturbances and estimated
amounts of succession classes.</p>
<p>We used the <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/clip.htm">“Clip
Raster”</a> tool in ArcGIS pro to extract the area of interest from a
broader extent of the raster data.</p>

<div class="figcaption">Figure 3. Map Zone 2 Ecosystem Footprint</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="reference-succession-class-amounts" class="section level3">
<h3>Reference succession class amounts</h3>
<p>For each BpS, we needed to know how much late-open and late-closed
each would have had historically. To do this, we referenced the BpS
descriptions which have those estimates, and descriptions of the
succession classes (visit <a
href="https://landfirereview.org/search.php">this site</a> to search for
BpS documents). For actual data work we used a modified version of the
<a
href="https://landfire.gov/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_Reference_Condition_Table_August_2020.zip">“Reference
Condition” table</a> (see modified data table below).</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of a BpS model, showing boxes, which represent
the succession classes, or structural stages of an ecosystem; lines
which represent succession and disturbances. What you don’t see here are
the quantitative disturbance inputs from the model, or the outputs which
include percent of each succession class that would have occurred
historically (visit the <a
href="https://thenatureconservancy.github.io/landfiremodels/">LANDFIRE
Vegetation Modeling site</a> to learn more about the modeling
process).</p>
<p>Since succession classes moved around the landscape LANDFIRE does not
map where they were historically, only delivering percentages.</p>

<div id="current-succession-classes" class="section level3">
<h3>Current Succession Classes</h3>
<p>Finally, we used the LANDFIRE <a
href="https://landfire.gov/sclass.php">succession class dataset</a> to
get an idea of how much of each succession class occurs per BpS on the
landscape today. Each pixel within a BpS is labled A through E for the
“reference” states, and also includes labels for other categories such
as agriculture and urban. We first used the <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/clip.htm">“clip
raster”</a> tool in ArcGIS pro to extract the area of interest from a
broader extent of the raster data. We then did a ‘combine’ using the <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/combine.htm">Combine
Tool</a> in ArcGIS pro of the BpS and succession class data to get a
dataframe with pixel counts of each unique combination of BpS and
succesion class to allow for estimating of the amounts of current
succession classes per BpS. We then used the <a
href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.1/tool-reference/data-management/join-field.htm">Join
Field Tool</a> to join the ‘BPS_NAME’, ‘BPS_MODEL’ attributes from the
BpS dataset, and the ‘Label’ attribute from the Succession Class dataset
(see output data example below).</p>
<p>The rules for defining the structural characteristics of each
succession class are in the <a
href="https://www.landfire.gov/bps-models.php">BpS descriptions</a>, and
are essentially combinations of height, cover and type. In a fictitious
example, if there was a pixel mapped as western hemlock douglas fir with
coniferious trees 25-50 M tall and with canopy cover 80-100% that might
be labled as class E, late-closed.</p>

<h2>Wrangling data post-GIS</h2>
<p>Once we have clipped, combined and attributed spatial data in ArcGIS
pro, we need to do a little data wrangling in R to further prep the
spatial data for mapping and to make some charts. In summary we:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the combined data attribute table and supporting data tables
from LANDFIRE into R (all located in ‘data’ directory in Git repo)
<ul>
<li>BpS-Succession Class Combined attribute table (named
“bps_scl_cmbn.csv”)</li>
<li>Succession Class Descriptions (named “scls_descriptions.csv”)</li>
<li>Reference condition percentages (named “ref_con_long.csv”)</li>
<li>Map Zone 2 Biophysical Settings (named “bps_mz2.csv”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build and join in succession class ‘descriptions’ (e.g.,
‘Late1-Closed’)</li>
<li>Do a little cleaning, and make a new ‘join_field’</li>
<li>Calculate reference and current acres per succession class per
BpS</li>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
