## Historic Ecosystems

This chart represents the historical ecosystems of our area of interest, split out by estimated acres of the various succession classes pre-European Settlement. On the left axis are names of LANDFIRE’s BpSs. On the bottom axis are number of acres. The colors represent the age classes.  The purple and orange areas represent late succession ecosystems. Late1 and Late2 don’t necessarily mean open/closed canopy.

There were 28 BpSs mapped in our area of interest.  In this chart we excluded BpSs with footprints of less than 10,000 acres for clarity. The North Pacific Maritime Mesic-Wet Douglas-fir-Western Hemlock Forest was most dominant at ~2.4 M acres with 1.7M acres of late successional habitat, followed by North Pacific Maritime Dry-Mesic Douglas-fir-Western Hemlock Forest at ~1.8 M acres and 1.1M acres of late successional habitat. Roughly 60% of the area is estimated to have been late successional habitat historically. Again, these are the “reference conditions” determined by local experts.

## Historic Late-Succesional %

This map represents the historical percentages of late-successional forest by ecosystem. Darker green areas indicate higher percentages of late-successional forest. For historical ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from 0-100%. Most areas fell within the 76-100% grouping. For this map, we used quantiles for the legend breaks. Percent late-successional forest was joined to the BpS data as an attribute in GIS.

## Current Late-Succesional %

This map represents the estimated current percentages of late-successional forest by ecosystem. Darker green areas indicate higher percentages of late-successional forest. For current ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from 0-100%. For this map, we used quantiles for the legend breaks.
Combination of BpS and SClass attributes.

Currently ~15% of the area is mapped as late succession. In the PNW we sometimes underestimate succession class height, and so the data may have been undermapped.

## Current Late-Succesional % Change

This map represents the percent change of late-successional forest by ecosystem. Darker green areas indicate an increase in the amount of LS forest, while brown areas indicate a loss. Percent of late successional forest ranged from an 81% loss to a 75% gain. Most areas saw a loss of 60% or more. For this map, we used jenks natural breaks for the legend breaks.

Some areas in the southern portion of the study area saw a net gain in LS forest. This is perhaps due to a history of fire suppression in the area, or an increase in different vegetation types. Land ownership includes land managed by USFS, BLM, and private landowners.

## Current Late-Succesional % Change

This chart shows change in amounts of late-successional habitat by ecosystem, from modeled historical to mapped 2020. On the left axis are names of LANDFIRE’s BpS.  On the bottom axis is the percent change from historical to present-day. The arrows/ecosystems are arranged in descending order from most prevalent to least (at the bottom). Yellow arrows indicate a loss, while the green ones represent a gain.

Almost all ecosystems have experienced substantial loss of late successional classes; 3 ecosystems experienced a gain in late successional classes. Once again, these represent percentages of the whole ecosystem.

## Historic Late-Successional % (open-canopy)

This map represents the percent of historic late-successional forest that is open canopy. Darker purple areas indicate higher amounts of open canopy forest. For historic open-canopy ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from 5-68%. For this map, we used jenks natural breaks for the legend breaks.

![Figure 11. Map of percent of historic late successional ecosystems that are classified as open canopy.](assets/historicOldGrowth_open.png){width=80%}

## Historic Late-Successional % (closed-canopy)

This map represents the percent of historic late-successional forest that is closed canopy. Darker red areas indicate higher amounts of closed canopy forest. For historic closed-canopy ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from 1-92%. For this map, we used jenks natural breaks for the legend breaks. Coastal areas get more rain and the eastern spots are drier due to rain shadow.

![Figure 12. Map of percent of historic late successional ecosystems that are classified as closed canopy.](assets/historicOldGrowth_closed.png){width=80%}

## Current Late-Successional % (open-canopy)

This map represents the percent of current late-successional forest that is open canopy. Darker purple areas indicate higher amounts of open canopy forest. For current open-canopy ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from 1-28%. For this map, we used jenks natural breaks for the legend breaks. There is very little open canopy ecosystem remaining.

![Figure 13. Map of percent of current late successional ecosystems that are classified as open canopy.](assets/currentOldGrowth_open.png){width=80%}

## Current Late-Successional % (closed-canopy)

This map represents the percent of current late-successional forest that is closed canopy. Darker red areas indicate higher amounts of closed canopy forest. For current closed-canopy ecosystems, percent of late successional forest ranged from less than 1% to 82%. For this map, we used jenks natural breaks for the legend breaks.

## Overall % Change in Late Successional Classes (Closed v. Open Canopy)

This chart shows change in amounts of late-successional open and closed canopy habitat by ecosystem, from modeled historical to mapped 2020. On the left axis are names of LANDFIRE’s BpSs.  On the bottom axis is the percent change from historical to present-day. The arrows/ecosystems are arranged in descending order from most prevalent to least (at the bottom). Yellow arrows indicate a loss, while the green ones represent a gain.

Example interpretation:
1) North Pacific Maritime Mesic-Wet Douglas-fir Western Hemlock Forest saw a ~73% decrease closed canopy and a ~5% decrease in open canopy.
2) Mediterranean California Dry-Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland saw a ~23% increase in closed canopy and a ~35% decrease in open canopy.
